# Fungi Protocol

## General
Fungiâ€™s mission is to bring the global asset management industry on-chain. We aim to use blockchain technology to create new solutions that are more transparent, efficient, and accessible than traditional asset management practices, democratizing access to DeFi and breaking down the barriers of complexity. 
Through the application of smart contracts and the integration with decentralized protocols, Fungi can automate asset management processes cutting out intermediaries and fees, enable greater control and ownership of assets by investors, and eliminate fraud entirely.
The investment vehicles created by Fungi to push this change forward are called DeFunds: Decentralized Investment Funds.

## Architecture<a name="architecture"></a>

The Fungi Protocol is built using the EIP-2535 (Multi-facet Proxy) standard. The contract logic is composed of one central **diamond** contract which is used to store all of the facets, and among these facets there is a factory which is used to create new DeFunds which are themselves diamonds.

All business logic is built using **facet** contracts which live in `src/Facets`.

For more information on EIP-2535 you can view the entire EIP [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).

### Contract Flow<a name="contract-flow"></a>

One example of use would be a manager creating a DeFund and build a portfolio. The manager would then develop a strategy to get the most out of the deposited assets received either from himself or other investors. The assets could then be used to stake, lend, or provide liquidity to a DEX.

The basic flow is illustrated below.

    D{DeFundDiamond}-- DELEGATECALL -->SwapperFacet;
    D{DeFundDiamond}-- DELEGATECALL -->LenderFacet;
    D{DeFundDiamond}-- DELEGATECALL -->StakerFacet;
    D{DeFundDiamond}-- DELEGATECALL -->LPFacet;
    D{DeFundDiamond}-- DELEGATECALL -->YieldFacet;
```

### Protocol Structure<a name="protocol-structure"></a>

The Fungi Protocol diamond holds all the facets required to create a DeFund and provide the necessary functionality to manage the assets. It is expected that the protocol will continually add more facets to provide more functionality and allow for more complex strategies.
